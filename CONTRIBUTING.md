# Contributing to BotMender

Thank you for taking interest in helping this project.
The guidelines specified in this document should make the process smoother for both of us.
Please make sure to read and follow them in order to minimize unnecessary work.

 - Do not make style changes, try to follow existing styles.
While there surely are exceptions, it's probably like that for a reason.
 - Only submit content this project is authorized to use.
No submitted content should conflict with the [project license](LICENSE).
Note the author, source, and license of the content if you are not its owner.
 - When submitting PRs, make sure to reference the issue the PR fixed, if any.
 - If you want to make huge changes to the project or if you are unsure about your idea,
you should open an issue to get feedback.
 - When you start working on an issue, you should make a comment letting others know about this.
Also, make sure to give frequent updates or time estimates, and most importantly note
when you decided to put development on hold, etc.

Feel free to contact [Trigary](https://github.com/Trigary) with your questions.
It's better to ask first and then work on something than to do it first and then spend time fixing it!

Thank you for reading this document.
If you are still interested in contributing, you may want to consider heading over to the
[issues](https://github.com/Trigary/BotMender/issues) page to find yourself something to do.
You should select an issue labeled with "help wanted".
If an issue is also labeled with "good first issue", then it requires very little knowledge
regarding the project - great for first time contributors!
